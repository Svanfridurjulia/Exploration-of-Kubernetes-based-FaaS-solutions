# Exploration of Kubernetes based FaaS solutions

This is a final project by three students finishing Bsc. in computer science and software engineering at Reykjav√≠k University. 

In this project we aim to explore the landscape for FaaS (Function as a Service) options on top of Kubernetes. The large cloud vendors have their own FaaS solutions such as AWS:Lambda, but that involves a different runtime, metrics and monitoring services for companies that are already running everything on Kubernetes. In this project, we want to explore how we can adapt a FaaS framework like OpenFaaS or KNative to help us make a well informed decision on what runtime we should choose for the future.
